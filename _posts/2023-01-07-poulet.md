If you're in the mood for some delicious French cuisine, then you'll want to check out Poulet, located in Central World.

Upon arriving, we were greeted by the friendly staff and seated at a cozy table. We started off with the French onion soup and garlic bread for the starter. The soup was rich and flavorful, and the garlic bread was the perfect accompaniment.

For the main course, we decided to try the half chicken with mushroom sauce and the truffle mushroom risotto. Both dishes were incredibly tasty and the mushroom sauce on the chicken was particularly noteworthy. The truffle mushroom risotto was a decadent and indulgent dish, and the flavors of the truffle really shone through, but was slightly too salty.

Although, I’d like to add that the chicken was only lukewarm when served and that table service was lacking, can’t order through staff, and pay at counter? It’s very unconventional for French cuisine, or any restaurant charging this price.

Overall, we would give Poulet a rating of 7.5/10. The food was excellent, but the prices were on the high side. However, for a special occasion or a night out with friends, we would definitely recommend Poulet. The atmosphere was sophisticated and the service was top-notch. If you're a fan of French cuisine, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.
