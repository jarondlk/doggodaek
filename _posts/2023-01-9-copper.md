I recently visited Copper International Buffet, located at The Sense Pinklao, and I was thoroughly impressed by the wide selection of dishes on offer. The buffet had a very high price point, but it was definitely worth it for the sheer variety of international cuisines available.

For starters, I particularly enjoyed the truffle soup and croissant as well as the fresh oysters with seafood chili sauce. Both dishes were delicious and really set the tone for the rest of the meal.

The main course had a lot to offer, with a range of options including wagyu steak, lamb steak, tom-yam grouper fish steak, wagyu sushi, fried crab padthai, and angel hair carbonara. It was difficult to choose, but everything I tried was cooked well.

The dessert selection was equally impressive, with highlights including the chocolate lava cake served with berries, cheese egg tart, salted egg French toast, vanilla milk pudding, and creme brulee. I was truly in heaven! The drinks selection was also top-notch, with on-tap jasmine tea and Taiwanese milk tea available.

Overall, I would give Copper International Buffet a rating of 8.5/10. The price was very high, but the quality of the food and the wide selection of dishes more than justified the cost. I would definitely recommend this buffet for anyone looking for a truly indulgent dining experience.
